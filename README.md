This program is designed to solve the following problem using JavaFX:

Statement
The bank Alfa wants to incentivize the management of personal finances for its clients. To achieve that, the IT team (of which you are a part) is requested to create an initial prototype in a JavaFX application.

The program will only have a module for income and expenses, which allows the user to add and delete income/expenses. Additionally, it displays the money balance.

Requirements
- The program should be able to display expenses and incomes in a table view (TableView).

- To register an expense/income, the user must enter the amount, a brief description of the expense/income, the type (whether it is an income or an expense), and the date.

- The program allows displaying the balance at all times, which is the difference between incomes and expenses.

- The program has three buttons. One allows viewing only the expenses, another allows viewing only the incomes, and another allows viewing the combined view. Only one TableView should be used for this.

- By default, the program should display the most recent records first, followed by the older ones.
